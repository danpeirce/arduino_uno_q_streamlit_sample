# Streamlit Example on a Arduino Uno Q

The Streamlit Brick on the Arduino Uno Q provides a method to create an interactive Web interface 
without writing any javascript code. On the date this readme file was created the only example 
Streamlit could I could find for the Arduino Uno Q was on github at:

* [Streamlit Test](https://github.com/hajimef/arduino_uno_q_streamlit_sample)

I felt the example would be easier for English speakers to follow if it were all in English using the Latin alphabet so I created a fork of the original repository and made the simple changes. My version is available at:

* [Streamlit Test fork](https://github.com/hajimef/arduino_uno_q_streamlit_sample)

A youtube video describing the original version can be found at:
